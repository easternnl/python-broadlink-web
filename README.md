# Configuration
Use the file irconfig.py to adjust the IR commands you want to use. The tool IrScrutinizer ( https://github.com/bengtmartensson/harctoolboxbundle/releases/tag/Version-1.4.1 ) can be used to generate the IR codes for your device. Also have a look at http://www.remotecentral.com/cgi-bin/codes/onkyo/ (in my case Onkyo)
